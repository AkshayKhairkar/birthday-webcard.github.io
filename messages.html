                        I can still remember our cab rides back from office bitching all about managers :p
                        Time has flied so fasst....it still feels like tomorrow. You are a self motivated person be the same and chase your dreams. Be it being a guitarist or an IIM student some day :P
                        Also Karen is a very sweet girl....we are expecting a good news soon :P<br>
                        I missed your concert in Bangalore though but want to experience it soon.
                        I hope my demands will be fulfilled one day as a return gift :D <br>
                        Happiest Birthday :)</p>

                        <p>Ahoyyy partner. <br>Writing this message brings back hell lot of wacky-Venky memories. Miss the cafeteria slow walk and those pointless but deep discussions. I somewhere thought the things would change when I join back after a year. But Kudos! Great things never change. Charamander knows she hasn't been in touch of a while, no excuses for that. Catch up soon, till then stay tall 😉
                        <br>Ps: Kindly visualize our boom hifi...👊🏻✋🏻</p>
