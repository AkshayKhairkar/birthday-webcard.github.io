                            <br /> Varsha the daughter. Varsha the sister. Varsha the friend. You have played many parts over your 21 year stay here, and we want to know how much you mean to all of us. Consider this our own little tribute to your presence in our lives.
                            <br />
                            <br /> A website has an unusually long life. We hope that this little website serves as a lasting reminder, a place where you can come to at any stage of your life, to be reminded of how much you mean to the people around you. We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making this for you. Let it remind you of the lives you've touched and the people who are better off for having known you.
                            <br /> Happy birthday and God bless Varsha. Jeeti rehna.
