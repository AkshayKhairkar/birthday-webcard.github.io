										<p>Happiest birthday bestie😘😘...Don't know how my 4 years of engineering would have been without you... You have been a constant support system in all the ups and downs... Thanks for bearing all my tantrums and nautanki... The moment I would always cherish is bunking on the first day of college and interacting with you... May the next phase of our lives be as beautiful as these 4 years have been and our friendship grows stronger.. <br />Love you Varsha ❤</p>

										<p>You had an amazing journey so far. Theres absolutely nothing that Varsha Shetty can't do. Right from TPC to all the extra projects to excellent academics you managed everything so well as if you have 48 hrs a day. Apart from this you also managed to maintain terror all over 😋😋. I always feel that you have a hidden knife and you'll kill me one day 😂😂.<br />
										'Kaushik teri pateli yaha nai chalegi' was the day i actually thought that mera khel ab khatam 😂😂<br />
										And chocolate heaven😍😍😍. No matter how many times we go, it has to be ferrero Rocher sundae😍. People cant eat even 1 😂 and we would always say 'doh to aram se kha sakte hai' :P<br />
										Theres so much to say but ill keep it short by just saying one thing - Thanks for having my back all the time. You are an amazing person<br />
										Happpiest Bday!!! Best wishes :)😊😊</p>

										<p>It is your b'day but instead of writing the usual starting line I'll just go with Congratulations Varsha! Congrats on completing 4 years of engineering... Not just completing it but crushing it! :P congrats on staying calm almost entirely for 4 years... Except for those times when you raise your voice and everyone goes silent in a second! Congrats on being omnipresent... You were literally present in the entire college anytime anywhere to help anyone who needed to get shit done! Congrats on being the voice of Comps 2017.. You may not have been the CR but whenever the class wants to approach any teacher they only have one name in mind! Congrats for achieving so much in so little time and for winning so many hearts! Always remain the same :D a very happy birthday!!</p>

										<p>Many many happy returns of the day Varsha !!! Can't believe that our friendship has almost crossed the four year mark. Seems like just yesterday, this shy and sincere girl, who wrote assignments for practically the entire class, became my friend. "Varsha, module 2.2 portion me hai kya", "Varsha chapter 4 kaha se padha", "Sir ne class me solve kiya uss sum ka pics bhej na" ye puchte puchte engineering hi khatam hone aa gaya. From being Kalbande's right hand to working more than Sikka during placements, you have done it all. Our class owes you a big big Thank You. The dinner at your house last year was just too good. The best south Indian meal I've had, hands down. And I don't say that very often when it comes to vegetarian food, so that's a big compliment. With some of us flying to the US and others pursuing their jobs here, I am not sure whether we all will be present to wish you personally on your next bday, hence instead of saying have a good year, I will say have an awesome life !!! Keep approaching life with the sincerity and dedication you possess and life will never dissapoint you. I will always treasure you as a great friend. And when I recieve an assignment to be submitted while studying abroad, I know whom to contact for the solution pics ;-) 
Happy Birthday and lots of well wishes,<br />
Tera dost,<br />
Vaibhav.</p>

										<p>Happiest birthday Varsha! We may not have been too close since first year, but I'm glad we got to know each other better in the past year. You are one of the most helpful people I have ever come across, as well as the most genuine. It's very difficult to find such people nowadays, which makes me cherish our friendship a lot 😘<br />
Always stay the same cuz you're amazing 😀<br />
Enjoy your day to the fullest! Have a great one! <br />
P.S. You will always be the only person I think of when I see dairy milk 😘</p>

										<p>Hey you, happy birthday ^^`<br /> 
We have reached the toughest point in our lives where I have to convince how wonderful a person you are through this message. While there is no way I am going to be able to squeeze it in a message, I am going to give it my best ;) 
You have a really warm presence and you're like a mother hen to our class, scratch that, to everyone you interact with. I am happy to have been lucky to see every side of you. I feel lucky to have received you as a partner in WT project after which every moment we've spent together has been amazing! I like that I got to know you more and with it we seemed to get along really well. It helps that you're a non vegetarian :p 
I am eager to see where this friendship takes is ;)</p>
