										<p>Hey Varsha <br /><br />

										Its your birthday today!!! 23th february 1996 to 23rd february 2017, 21 years of selflessness!! You are a inspiration and motivation to everyone who knows you.<br /> Out of these 21 years, we have known each other for just 1 year, remember last 23rd february, our placement orientation. Meine bithake rakha tha tujhe, orientation PPT bananeko. That was the time from when we actually started to interact more, and its exactly 1 year now. I could very well say this is also our first friendship anniversary. :P <br />

										Our friendship will see its share of speedbreakers, but I really hope and pray to god that it should never come to a stop. We may not have alot of memories to share as such, but the one I allways cherish will be my 23rd birthday party with the placement team. That was one fun day. We do sometimes have small disagreements ( moreover caused by me, i agree ) but thats the way true friends are right. <br />

										A person like you varsha,is a rare gem in this world. I really pray that god gives you all the happiness available in this world, gives you all that you deserve. <br />

										I take your 21st birthday as an opportunity to say just one thing -- Thank you for being my friend. Hope that this friendship lives long. <br /><br />

										Again, Happy birthday Varsha :)

										<p>Hey Varsha, many happy returns of the day!<br />
It's been 4 years since we've known each other, and the friendship has come a long way since then.<br />
The very first memory of us together I have is where we sat for nearly 4hours printing 60 students' ED assignments😂.<br />
It has been so heartwarming to know that kind people like you are still there, and I wish to have the kind of willingness you have to help people in the best of your capacity :*<br />
Please stay the same always <br />
Lots of love,<br />
Prachi😘</p>

										Although we haven't known each other for long it seems like we've been friends since years. Calm, active and dedicated; no other words can describe you better. Always the sane one with occasional bursts of madness make you one of the most balanced people I know. I love to tease you and see you smile. Stay the same and always keep smiling. May you have all the happiness in the world. Love you!!!!!
