										<p>Shaaavaar!!<br />
										On your 21st budday ,(ooh Finally badi ho gayii!) :-<br />
										Whenever anyone mentions the word, "Friend ", I do think of you! But as I ponder over the thought,I realize that you are not just any 'friend' that I have; you are way more than that!<br />
										A perfect combination of a sister,guide,mentor,philosopher (most of the times :p) and my Soulmate! <3 #MyGoToPerson!<br />
										Everyone would talk about how much a friend means to them and have done for them. But I guess I would just say , my day or life would have been really incomplete without you!:*<br />
										I know times have changed and we hardly get to meet in this busy schedule of ours, but I also know that this friendship or this inexplicable relation that we share would never fade come what may. And trust me who other than you know the number of times, end number of friendships in our lives have already faded yet ours was the one which stood strong and will always do!<br />
										I wish you all the happiness and success in the coming important years, Shaaavar !! I'm sure you would do well and make your family proud as always! <br />
										You have already proved as a wonderful daughter and a sister with the wise decisions you have always made for them! I thank aunty and uncle for giving us such a precious gift that I would treasure all my life!<br />
										Lastly, #LongLiveTrinity! 😜🙈🙉🙊<br />
										Signing off with the last line since it has already been a pretty long note(like always;) )<br />
										~Stay the same always and never change for anyone! 😀Love you loads!</p>

										<p>Hey! You know I suck at this and you even know I remind you this every year that I do. How am I supposed to write about someone who has always been around.. since forever? I can't list down what I like about you or what I don't.. I love you as a whole, just the way you are.. and it's so much happiness that you have someone around whenever you want them.. sometimes we talk all day.. and sometimes not even for days together.. but the best part is, nothing changes.. nothing has and nothing will.. In a world trying to constantly change who you are, you have always managed to be yourself and never stopped being  so good as a person.. no matter what happens with you, no matter who does what to you.. you are invariably too nice to them! And that's why I believe good things will always happen to you.. You will soon start with a job and things will change, but I know I won't let anything between us change.. cause I'd be a fool to let go something so beautiful! I love you a lot. Ab baaki ke emotions tu samajh le. Enjoy your year. Let's create more memories.. let's have more fun.. let's cry and laugh together.. Stay happy! :)</p>

										<p>Hey shawaaar....<br /> When someone says Varsha I have a flashback! A huge one! A flashback which just puts a wide smile across my face.

											<br />Man you've disappeared and I desperately miss a sister so understanding as you! 
											<br />Have a marvelous birthday 96 born 🙈👻

											<br /><br />Love ya loads, meet up before I leave (get in touch to know more in case u don't 😂)
