										<p>Hey Varsha, many happy returns of the day!<br />
It's been 4 years since we've known each other, and the friendship has come a long way since then.<br />
The very first memory of us together I have is where we sat for nearly 4hours printing 60 students' ED assignmentsüòÇ.<br />
It has been so heartwarming to know that kind people like you are still there, and I wish to have the kind of willingness you have to help people in the best of your capacity :*<br />
Please stay the same always <br />
Lots of love,<br />
Prachiüòò</p>

										Although we haven't known each other for long it seems like we've been friends since years. Calm, active and dedicated; no other words can describe you better. Always the sane one with occasional bursts of madness make you one of the most balanced people I know. I love to tease you and see you smile. Stay the same and always keep smiling. May you have all the happiness in the world. Love you!!!!!
